The goal of this tutorial is to dive into a simple iOS recipe - how to play sounds and use AVFoundation. The most important skill of a great application developer is being able to solve your own problems and find out how to use existing tools by reading the documentation. So we’ll teach you exactly that so that when you graduate and start making your own apps, you’ll know how to program the features you want in your own app.
